<p><h2 id="qw1"> The candy originated in the United States in 1941, and M&M's have been sold in over 100 countries since 2003.<br><br>
They are produced in different colors, and has breeded many varvarieties, some made available for a limited time, such as white cheesecake for Easter, pumpkin spice or white candy corn for Halloween, and White Strawberry Shortcake for Valentine's Day.<br><br>
The candy-coated chocolate concept was inspired by a method used to allow soldiers in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) to carry chocolate in warm climates without it melting.<br><br>
The company's longest-lasting slogan reflects this: "Melts in your mouth, not in your hand." </h2> </br> </p>
