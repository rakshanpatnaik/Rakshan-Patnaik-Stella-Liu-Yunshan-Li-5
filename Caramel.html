<p><h2 id="qw1"> First produced in the United Kingdom in 1967, and introduced in the United States in 1979. <br><br>
It was called Raider in mainland Europe for many years before its name was changed in 1991 (2000 in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Turkey) to match the international brand name. <br><br>
The original is an awesome combination of crunchy cookie, delicious caramel and creamy chocolate. Perfect for sharing. <br><br>
However, there are Twix flavors for every person. There are bars with peanut butter, triple chocolate, and cookies n cream fillings! In addition to these flavors, Twix introduced Left Twix and Right Twix. Mars says they are made differently, but most people say they taste the same. It's up to you to choose a side! </h2> </br> </p>
